## Overview

`PowerNetworkMatrices.jl` is a [`Julia`](http://www.julialang.org) package for
the evaluation of network matrices given the system's data. The package allows to compute
the matrices according to different methods, providing a flexibe and powerful tool.

The documentation and code are organized according to the needs of different
users depending on their skillset and requirements. In broad terms there are three categories:

- **Modeler**: Users that want to run a particular analysis or experiment and use `PowerNetworkMatrices.jl` to develop data sets.

- **Model Developer**: Users that want to develop custom components and structs in order to exploit `PowerNetworkMatrices.jl` features to produce custom data sets.

- **Code Base Developers**: Users that want to add new core functionalities or fix bugs in the core capabilities of `PowerNetworkMatrices.jl`.

`PowerNetworkMatrices.jl` is an active project under development, and we welcome your feedback,
suggestions, and bug reports.

## Installation

The latest stable release of PowerNetworkMatrices can be installed using the Julia package manager with

```julia
] add PowerNetworkMatrices
```

For the current development version, "checkout" this package with

```julia
] add PowerNetworkMatrices#master
```
