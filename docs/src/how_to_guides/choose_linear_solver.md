# How to Choose a Linear Solver

This guide helps you select the appropriate linear solver for your network matrix computations.

## Available Solvers

`PowerNetworkMatrices.jl` supports three linear solver methods:

1. **KLU** (default) - Sparse solver using KLU factorization
2. **Dense** - Dense matrix operations
3. **MKLPardiso** - Intel's MKL Pardiso solver (Intel systems only)

## Choosing the Right Solver

### Use KLU When:

- Working with typical power systems (most cases)
- System size is medium to large (> 100 buses)
- You want good performance without special dependencies
- Running on any platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)

Use [`PTDF`](@ref) with the default KLU solver:
```julia
ptdf_matrix = PTDF(sys)  # KLU is the default
# or explicitly:
ptdf_matrix = PTDF(sys, linear_solver="KLU")
```

### Use Dense When:

- System is very small (< 30 buses)
- You're debugging or validating results
- Matrix operations are simple and small-scale

Specify the Dense solver explicitly:
```julia
ptdf_matrix = PTDF(sys, linear_solver="Dense")
```

### Use MKLPardiso When:

- You have Intel processors
- Running on Linux or Windows (not available on macOS)
- Maximum performance is critical
- Working with very large systems (> 1000 buses)

Specify the MKLPardiso solver:
```julia
ptdf_matrix = PTDF(sys, linear_solver="MKLPardiso")
```

## Performance Considerations

### System Size

| Buses | Recommended Solver |
|-------|-------------------|
| < 30  | Dense or KLU |
| 30-1000 | KLU |
| > 1000 | KLU or MKLPardiso |

### Platform Availability

| Solver | Linux | Windows | macOS |
|--------|-------|---------|-------|
| KLU | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Dense | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| MKLPardiso | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |

## Switching Solvers

You can easily switch between solvers to compare performance:

```julia
using BenchmarkTools

# Benchmark KLU
@btime ptdf_klu = PTDF($sys, linear_solver="KLU")

# Benchmark Dense
@btime ptdf_dense = PTDF($sys, linear_solver="Dense")

# Benchmark MKLPardiso (if available)
@btime ptdf_mkl = PTDF($sys, linear_solver="MKLPardiso")
```

## Troubleshooting

### MKLPardiso Not Available

If you get an error when using MKLPardiso:

1. Verify you're on Linux or Windows (not macOS)
2. Check that you have Intel processors
3. Ensure MKL dependencies are installed

Fall back to KLU if MKLPardiso is unavailable.
