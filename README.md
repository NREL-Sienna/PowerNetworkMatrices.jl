`PowerNetworkMatrices.jl` is able to build classic power systems modeling network matrices such as
[Ybus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodal_admittance_matrix), [PTDF](https://www.powerworld.com/WebHelp/Content/MainDocumentation_HTML/Power_Transfer_Distribution_Factors.htm) and [LODF](https://www.powerworld.com/WebHelp/Content/MainDocumentation_HTML/Line_Outage_Distribution_Factors_LODFs.htm#:~:text=Line%20Outage%20Distribution%20Factors%20(LODFs)%20are%20a%20sensitivity%20measure%20of,other%20lines%20in%20the%20system.).

## Version Advisory

- PowerNetworkMatrices.jl will work with Julia v1.6+. In Mac the requirement is to have Julia 1.9.2+ due to issues with MKL and dynamic library loading.
- PowerNetworkMatrices.jl exports Matrix methods that were available in PowerSystems.jl version 1.0 and have been implemented as a separate package.
