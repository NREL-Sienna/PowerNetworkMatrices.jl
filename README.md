`PowerNetworkMatrices.jl` is able to build classic power systems modeling network matrices such as
[Ybus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodal_admittance_matrix), [PTDF](https://www.powerworld.com/WebHelp/Content/MainDocumentation_HTML/Power_Transfer_Distribution_Factors.htm), [LODF](https://www.powerworld.com/WebHelp/Content/MainDocumentation_HTML/Line_Outage_Distribution_Factors_LODFs.htm#:%7E:text=Line%20Outage%20Distribution%20Factors%20(LODFs)%20are%20a%20sensitivity%20measure%20of,other%20lines%20in%20the%20system.) and [MODF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17529v1)

## Version Advisory

  - PowerNetworkMatrices.jl will work with Julia v1.10+.
  - PowerNetworkMatrices.jl exports Matrix methods that were available in PowerSystems.jl version 1.0 and have been implemented as a separate package since 2022.
