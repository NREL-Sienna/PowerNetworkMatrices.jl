    ZeroImpedanceBranchReduction <: NetworkReduction

Merges buses connected by zero-impedance non-transformer branches. Always
applied as the first step of `Ybus(sys; ...)` to avoid singular admittances;
pass via the `zero_impedance_reduction` kwarg to override parameters — putting
one in `network_reductions` is rejected.

An off-diagonal `Y[i,j]` is treated as zero-impedance when `real(Y[i,j]) == 0`
and `imag(Y[i,j]) >= susceptance_threshold`. The from-bus survives unless the
to-bus is in the user-supplied irreducible set, in which case the sides flip.

# Fields
- `susceptance_threshold::Float64 = ZERO_IMPEDANCE_BRANCH_YBUS_SUSCEPTANCE_THRESHOLD`
- `minimum_retained_impedance::Float64 = ZERO_IMPEDANCE_X_EPSILON`: substitute
  reactance for branches with `r == x == 0` during Ybus assembly.
