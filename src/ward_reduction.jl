    get_ward_reduction(data, bus_lookup, bus_axis, boundary_buses, ref_bus_numbers, study_buses)

Perform Ward reduction to create an equivalent network representation.

Ward reduction is a network reduction technique that eliminates external buses while preserving 
the electrical characteristics seen from the study buses. External buses are mapped to boundary 
buses based on impedance criteria, and equivalent admittances are computed.

# Arguments
- `data::SparseArrays.SparseMatrixCSC{ComplexF32, Int}`: Admittance matrix of the system
- `bus_lookup::Dict{Int, Int}`: Dictionary mapping bus numbers to matrix indices
- `bus_axis::Vector{Int}`: Vector of all bus numbers in the system
- `boundary_buses::Set{Int}`: Set of boundary bus numbers between study and external areas
- `ref_bus_numbers::Set{Int}`: Set of reference bus numbers
- `study_buses::Vector{Int}`: Vector of study bus numbers to retain

# Returns
- `Tuple`: Contains bus reduction map, reverse bus search map, added branch map, and added admittance map
