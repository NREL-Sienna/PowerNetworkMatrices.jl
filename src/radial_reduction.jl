    RadialReduction <: NetworkReduction

Network reduction algorithm that eliminates radial (dangling) buses and their associated branches
from the power network. Radial buses are leaf nodes with only one connection that do not affect
the electrical behavior of the rest of the network.

# Fields
- `irreducible_buses::Vector{Int}`: List of bus numbers that should not be eliminated even if they are radial

# Examples
```julia
# Create radial reduction with no protected buses
reduction = RadialReduction()

# Create radial reduction protecting specific buses
reduction = RadialReduction(irreducible_buses=[101, 205])

# Apply to system
ybus = Ybus(system; network_reductions=[reduction])
```

"""
Pre-compute a mapping from each row (branch) in a CSC sparse matrix to its two column
(bus) endpoints. This avoids the expensive `A[row, :].nzind` operation on CSC matrices
which requires a full scan of all columns (O(nnz) per call).

Returns a Vector where index `row` gives `(col1, col2)` — the two bus columns connected
by that branch.

    calculate_radial_arcs(A::SparseArrays.SparseMatrixCSC{Int8, Int}, arc_map::Dict{Tuple{Int, Int}, Int}, bus_map::Dict{Int, Int}, ref_bus_positions::Set{Int})

Identify and calculate radial branches and buses that can be eliminated from the network model
by analyzing the topological structure of the incidence matrix. Radial elements are leaf nodes
with only one connection that do not affect the electrical behavior of the core network.

# Arguments
- `A::SparseArrays.SparseMatrixCSC{Int8, Int}`:
        The incidence matrix data representing bus-branch connectivity structure
- `arc_map::Dict{Tuple{Int, Int}, Int}`:
        Dictionary mapping branch endpoint pairs (from_bus, to_bus) to matrix row indices
- `bus_map::Dict{Int, Int}`:
        Dictionary mapping bus numbers to matrix column indices
- `ref_bus_positions::Set{Int}`:
        Set of matrix column indices corresponding to reference (slack) buses that cannot be eliminated

# Returns
- `bus_reduction_map::Dict{Int, Set{Int}}`:
        Dictionary mapping parent bus numbers to sets of child buses that can be reduced to the parent
- `reverse_bus_search_map::Dict{Int, Int}`:
        Dictionary mapping each bus number to its ultimate parent bus after all reductions
- `radial_arcs::Set{Tuple{Int, Int}}`:
        Set of branch endpoint pairs representing radial branches that can be eliminated
- `final_arc_map::Dict{Tuple{Int, Int}, Int}`:
        Dictionary mapping each final arc to the surviving bus number it connects to
        (the arc whose admittance must be subtracted from the surviving bus's diagonal)

# Algorithm Overview
1. **Adjacency Pre-computation**: Builds adjacency lists from the incidence matrix to avoid
   expensive sparse row access operations on the CSC matrix
2. **Leaf Detection**: Identifies buses with exactly one connection (radial buses)
3. **Reference Protection**: Preserves reference buses from elimination regardless of connectivity
4. **Iterative Chain Walking**: Uses a queue-based approach to trace from radial buses toward
   the core network, walking through chains of degree-2 buses
5. **Cascading Reduction**: Eliminates buses that become radial after initial reductions

# Network Topology Preservation
- **Electrical Equivalence**: Ensures reduced network maintains same electrical behavior
- **Connectivity Integrity**: Preserves essential network connectivity and reference structure
- **Reduction Validity**: Only eliminates elements that truly don't affect network analysis
- **Reversibility**: Maintains mapping information for potential reconstruction if needed

# Use Cases
- **Network Simplification**: Reduces computational burden by eliminating unnecessary elements
- **Matrix Conditioning**: Improves numerical properties of network matrices
- **Analysis Acceleration**: Speeds up power flow and other network computations
- **Memory Optimization**: Reduces storage requirements for large network models

# Implementation Notes
- Pre-computes row-to-column mapping for O(1) branch endpoint lookup instead of O(nnz) sparse
  row access
- Uses iterative queue-based processing instead of recursive DFS for better performance
- Handles edge cases like fully radial networks and isolated islands
- Provides comprehensive mapping for traceability and debugging
