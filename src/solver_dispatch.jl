# Shared dispatch for "run a solve under whatever solver we have." Lives
# outside the Virtual{PTDF, LODF, MODF} files so all three matrices share
# the same `with_solver` seam and the same KLU/AppleAccelerate factory.
#
# All libklu activity in this process serializes through `_LIBKLU_LOCK`
# (see `KLUWrapper.jl`). A pool-of-independent-caches design was tried
# and removed: empirically, distinct `Numeric`/`Symbolic`/`Common` per
# thread does not prevent libklu state corruption, and the per-cache
# `solver_lock` we hold here further serializes any non-libklu work in
# the callback. One factor + one cache per Virtual matrix is what
# remains — same throughput as the pool variant once the global lock
# is in place.
#
# Apple's libSparse has no documented cross-handle corruption issue
# analogous to `_LIBKLU_LOCK`; the per-cache `solver_lock` we acquire
# here is sufficient for the `AAFactorCache` backend.

    with_solver(f, K, work_ba_col, temp_data, solver_lock) -> result

Acquire `solver_lock`, then invoke `f(K, work_ba_col[1], temp_data[1])`.
Three overloads: `KLULinSolveCache{Float64}` (KLU backend), `AAFactorCache`
(Apple Accelerate backend), and a generic fallback. All serialize through
`solver_lock`; the per-cache scratch slot at index 1 is the only slot —
`work_ba_col` and `temp_data` are single-element vectors, kept as
`Vector{Vector{Float64}}` because `_solve_factorization` is typed on
`Vector{Float64}` and the two buffers have different lengths
(`n_buses` vs. `n_buses - n_ref_buses`).
