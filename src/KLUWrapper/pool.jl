"""
A pool of independent `KLULinSolveCache` workers, each holding its own
factorization of the same matrix.

KLU mutates per-numeric scratch and the `klu_l_common` `status` field during
`klu_solve`, so a single cache cannot be safely shared across threads.
The pool sidesteps that by allocating one full cache per worker. Acquisition
is gated on a `Channel{Int}`; pair acquire/release via [`with_worker`](@ref)
so the worker is always returned even on exception.

The matrix is factored `nworkers` times — pay this cost up front to gain
O(nworkers) parallel solves later.

Refresh the numeric factorization on every currently-valid worker. Blocks
until all valid workers are idle (i.e., have been returned to the pool by

operations (`numeric_refactor!` / `reset!`) are serialized internally via
`pool.admin_lock`. Failure rates:

- `0` failures: all workers refreshed, pool unchanged.
- `1 .. ⌊n/2⌋` failures (degraded mode): failed workers are held out of the
  channel; the pool keeps running with the surviving workers. A warning is
  emitted. The first underlying error is rethrown so callers can react if
  they want to.
- `> ⌊n/2⌋` and `< n` failures: triggers an auto-reset — `full_factor!` is
  invoked on every worker (including survivors) to restore a uniform state.
  If the reset succeeds, the pool is fully restored. If it does not, every
  worker that still fails keeps a failed factorization and the first reset
  error is thrown.
- `n` failures (every worker): the matrix is treated as fundamentally bad;
  no auto-reset is attempted (`full_factor!` would just fail again on the
  same matrix). All workers are flagged as failed factorizations, no workers
  are returned to the channel, and the first error is thrown. Acquirers
  blocked on `take!` are unblocked with a sentinel so they throw a clear
